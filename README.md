# PickMi
Deciding where to eat can be hard. Different people have different considerations in making a decision. For instance, at one moment, they might want a hassle-free, no queue dining spot. In another instance, they just want to have cheap Thai food nearby. Or sometimes, people just have no preference at all!

Wouldnâ€™t it be wonderful if there is an app that can decide for you based on the selection you made?! 

This project aims to serve users a better, faster, and more efficient process in deciding their dining spots.
